Limited resources available to the IRCS Kerala branch prior to the disaster meant a significant scale-up was needed to reach the operational capacity level to implement the response. In August 2018, the branch had almost no trained volunteers available, only had one vehicle (an ambulance) to transport people and a limited number of staffs at headquarter. The branch also lacked the experience, primarily in disaster management, to handle such a large disaster. This resulted in difficulties in many operational aspects, from planning to coordination and data collection. Surge support was dispatched from NHQ, other branches and internationally to reinforce Kerala branch’s capacity, but the limited resources remained an issue throughout the operation

Most community member have limited knowledge on how to make a referral. Now, only few people reported PGI case to the Vanuatu Women Center (VWC) officers in the area and are referred directly to VWC in Port-Vila for further assessment. There is an existing gap in the referral system as there is no police presence in the area, and other essential service providers to assist the survivors of violence and their families experiencing any form of violence. A SGBV Committee was formed on March 15, 2019 in Port-Vila comprised of partners from VRCS, Strong Fiuja, UNWomen, Save the Children, Vanuatu Family Health Association, VPride, Police Family Protection Unit who are keen in collaborating to the referral pathways specific to SGBV in Vanuatu.

However, it didn’t affect the distribution plan. The majority of shelter toolkits reached beneficiaries one and a half month from the event, and they were no longer the immediate need of the community anymore at that time. Shelter toolkits would have its best use in the first one or two weeks after the typhoon. Options to consider cash distribution would have also been an option, but requires quick internal processing and distribution.
