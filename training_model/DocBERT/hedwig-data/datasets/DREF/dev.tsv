Georgia Red Cross Society Disaster Management department was an overall responsible for the DREF operation in Georgia, affecting the population by floods.

Given that the flood events were not declared a national disaster by the government, there was poor coordination at the National Level with the key partner stakeholders such as the Directorate of Disaster Risk Management and UN agencies in the country, resulting in poor resources mobilisations to reach the needy. This subsequently resulted in low media coverage of the events in the communities that could contribute to significant awareness of local and international potential donors. In order for the NRCS to counter these, National Society organised a field visit with some media and local government representatives to familiarise themselves with the ground situation. The visits enabled government representatives to engage with the affected, listen to the plights of the people and coordinate response with the National Society based on limited resources.
