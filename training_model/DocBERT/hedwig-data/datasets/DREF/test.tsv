Throughout the operation, PMI documented 174 feedback/complaints/questions from the affected population in their CEA logbook (information management system). It is postulated that many details from the displaced people were not recorded, but did indeed take place at the evacuation centers due to a lack of human resources at the provincial and district levels. There could have been dedicated support and supervision on this component. It was assessed that the response teams often held a broad responsibility to manage various needs of the response and regular programming, thus overlooking efforts to maximize CEA work. In addition, observations from the socio-cultural and religious aspects of Bali show that local communities are reluctant to express their feedback. This is especially so when done to individuals and aid organizations that have helped them through their hardships and difficult times. Despite the wide promotion of feedback loops in the communities that PMI served during the response, there were less inquiries provided by the community members due to these socio-cultural norms.

In addition, the limited Communications staff familiar with Communications and Diplomacy within the NRCS resulted in work backlog for the only Communications Manager who struggled to make time out to travel to the field.

VRCS volunteers could benefit from more simulation exercises utilising all resources and forms through-out the year so that they are ready and confident during a response. Simulations are historically strictly DM related, an integration of emergency health and first aid into these simulations and ERT trainings would be of significant benefit.

While the volunteers were carrying out the malnutrition screening and referral to the nutritional Centres, the Red Cross discovered that there was a shortage of nutritional food at the health/nutritional centres for the treatment of the SAM and the MAM cases. Most of the cases referred to the nutritional centres were thus not assisted. Therefore, the community-based malnutrition screening activity had to be stopped as the Red Cross could not carry on the identification of malnourished people without any adequate treatment measures provided to them afterwards.
