Accordingly, there was lack of previous experience working with the local responders, as Police, Ambulances and etc. In case the branch volunteers needed to be involved during the demonstrations, the NS had no sufficient capacity to transport big number of volunteers to the capital city.

The Lessons Learnt and Planning workshop was planned to be a three-day workshop which will need to be shortened on the online platform.

In other cases, it was a recommendation by the chapter to wait until the dry food items delivered through the Department of Social Welfare and Development and non-government agencies had stopped and the community were still in need. At that time cash was the most appropriate response to give the community the choice to buy foods, livelihoods support or other priority items. During the focus group discussion with the chapters, they mentioned that for the perspective of beneficiaries, the cash was very timely for their needs since they were able to use it for their food needs due and others used it to buy agricultural inputs to kick-start livelihood activities.

"1187","It is worth mentioning again that the Kerala IRCS branch did not have much experience in disaster response. Because of this, the approach of community engagement and accountability, which includes a range on concepts and technics to ensure the communities are at the centre of our work, may not be fully integrated yet in some instances. This does not mean affected communities were not consulted or involved in the response process, but more efforts are needed to improve how assistance is being planned and delivered for future operation.","Policy Strategy and Standards"

"1216","it was highlighted that during the summer months, prevention campaign should be conducted as soon as possible because incidence of casualty due to water accident was very high. It was stated that out of all the hazards, water incidents were reported to cause the highest number of casualties.

"2744","Throughout the operation, PMI documented 174 feedback/complaints/questions from the affected population in their CEA logbook (information management system). It is postulated that many details from the displaced people were not recorded, but did indeed take place at the evacuation centers due to a lack of human resources at the provincial and district levels. There could have been dedicated support and supervision on this component. It was assessed that the response teams often held a broad responsibility to manage various needs of the response and regular programming, thus overlooking efforts to maximize CEA work. In addition, observations from the socio-cultural and religious aspects of Bali show that local communities are reluctant to express their feedback. This is especially so when done to individuals and aid organizations that have helped them through their hardships and difficult times. Despite the wide promotion of feedback loops in the communities that PMI served during the response, there were less inquiries provided by the community members due to these socio-cultural norms.","Policy Strategy and Standards"

In addition, the limited Communications staff familiar with Communications and Diplomacy within the NRCS resulted in work backlog for the only Communications Manager who struggled to make time out to travel to the field.
