In terms of cash expenditure, 99 per cent found the money useful to cover their most important family needs. - When asked their opinion of the Red Cross emergency cash relief program, 87 per cent reported that they found the whole program good and helpful and it made them happy and thankful. Seven per cent did not have any comment, two per cent was satisfied another two per cent had agreed on the cash assistance they have received while 1% found the distribution process as good. - In terms of transparency to the amount that the community is going to receive, 63 per cent reported that they were informed. - There were seven per cent who also believed that the cash assistance created tension among beneficiary and nonbeneficiary. When asked for the reason, respondents said that it was because some people thought that they also deserved to be a beneficiary. Based on these results, PRC will further intensify its information dissemination through an established CEA mechanism on providing relevant information to the beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries on selection criteria and beneficiary prioritization. - Cash versus NFI: All the respondents for cash and NFI survey were asked if the assistance were to be redone, which would they prefer to receive, cash or NFI’s. 75% said that they would prefer cash rather an NFI.

There could have been dedicated support and supervision on this component. It was assessed that the response teams often held a broad responsibility to manage various needs of the response and regular programming, thus overlooking efforts to maximize CEA work. In addition, observations from the socio-cultural and religious aspects of Bali show that local communities are reluctant to express their feedback. This is especially so when done to individuals and aid organizations that have helped them through their hardships and difficult times.
