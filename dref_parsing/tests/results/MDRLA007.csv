0,"The procurement of relief and hygiene kits was time consuming, as some items such as food items requires approval from the IFRC’s APRO as well as required paperwork from the vendors. The cost of distribution was quite high, as all items were procured at the headquarter in Vientiane and then delivered to the affected provinces. As a result, the relief and hygiene kits reached to the affected people took almost two months after the floods occurred.",Challenges,Livelihoods and Basic Needs,MDRLA007,Flood,Lao People's Democratic Republic,2020-10-22,Asia Pacific

5,"LRC had limited volunteers that are trained and ready to be deployed in short notice to support disaster response. Most activities were undertaken by staff from either HQ or branch. Most of the time, LRC uses “ad hoc” volunteers at community level to provide support in their area, which means they have no understanding or training to conduct activities and hence need to be trained before being asked to support response operations. This slows down response time and limited the capacity to support affected communities on a larger scale in multiple areas at once.",Challenges,Water Sanitation and Hygiene,MDRLA007,Flood,Lao People's Democratic Republic,2020-10-22,Asia Pacific
