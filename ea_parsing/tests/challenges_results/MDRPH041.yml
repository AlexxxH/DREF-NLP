  - Lack of trained volunteers to implement the project under the operations. Another
    challenge was the sustainability of skilled and capable volunteers. Volunteer
    turnover is a common problem in most of the areas, where volunteers leave for
    work or migrate. In addition, some of the volunteers were not aware of all existing
    policies for emergency operations (SOP and policies).
  - Overlapping of activities (conflict of schedule between community and chapters).
  - The CSG and CMLP are in their exploration stage, thus issues are anticipated to
    arise. Implementing chapters and groups mentioned the need for improved project
    guidelines, monitoring tools, and progress assessment among others. At present
    PRC is revising/upgrading the guidelines with technical support from IFRC Livelihood
    Centre.

  items:
  - Most of the staff and volunteers were trained only on emergency,but were not trained
    to provide other services (i.e., PFA, CFS, health service,). Hence, the number
    of equipped volunteers with the knowledge to provide initial response to individuals
    experiencing psychological distress were limited.
  - There was a limitation on the movement due to the pandemic. Staff and volunteers
    have encountered the risk contracting COVID-19 during operation. Necessary protocols
    were put in place to lessen the risk.
