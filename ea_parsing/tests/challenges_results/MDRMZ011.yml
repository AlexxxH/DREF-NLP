  items:
  - In some areas, as the volunteers were distributing Certeza, the water purification liquid, they were chased by some community members who thought that the liquid would cause them cholera. In this situation, the volunteers focused on those households that accepted them and use these households to advocate for the use of drinking treated water to prevent cholera.
  - First time volunteers felt insecure reaching out to households for sensitization. There was need for confidence building and pairing up of volunteers (new and old) to give the necessary support to reach to the households.
  - When the volunteers used the megaphones to announce their presence, in some areas, the community members left their homes and were not found in the homesteads by the volunteers. This meant that the volunteers went back to these households where members were missing to conduct their awareness sessions.
  - A lot of time was spent in covering these areas. For the available households, awareness sessions were conducted during the first visit
  - The CVM health focal point was on sick leave during the first three months of the operation that also hampered the progress and CVM capacity in combating cholera. As a result, a temporary focal point was nominated to fill the gap however; confusion in coordination with branches and other stakeholders were reported.

  items:
  - "1. There was delay in release of NFIs from warehouse in Maputo and finding transport solution to deliver the items to the affected provinces. This in turn led to the delay in distribution of relief to the affected populations thereby affecting CVM response time. Some of the beneficiaries had to wait up to more than two weeks to receive support. Lack of transportation and inability of CVM to engage private transport companies without upfront payment led to this delay. When transport was available, it was shared with other stakeholders therefore preference was given to the delivery of the stakeholder\u2019s items over those of CVM further contributing to delayed response."
  - 2. SPHERE standards was used in planning for the operation yet at the time of implementation, the stock available was not enough to enable sufficient distribution hence in some cases, only one blanket was given per household due to fewer numbers available in stock.
  - 3. Slow funds transfer from the IFRC and slow funds accountability from CVM.
  - 4. The displaced households were allocated land for construction of dwellings yet there was no land allocated for livelihood activities like farming, especially for the community in Nacogolone.
  - '5. At the time of the evaluation, shelter construction had not been completed as expected due to the following reasons:'
  - a) There was delay and irregular delivery of blocks and small stones for construction by the supplier.
  - b) Plans had been made to have the supplier make the blocks at the construction sites but the quality of these blocks were poor compared to those delivered from Quelimane further affecting the structures that were being built.
  - c) The beneficiaries in 1 de Maio and Mudiba during the evaluation expressed their inability to complete the construction due to financial constraints hence the need to demonstrate how the structures could be completed in a more affordable way without necessarily using the expensive concrete blocks.
  - d) There were also structural errors noticed with regards with the way the roofing had been built that led to some roofs being blown off a week before the evaluation began. This required technical expertise to establish what corrective measure could be done to ensure a structurally sound structure handed over to the communities.
  - e) Some of the timber and iron were purchased twice because they were stolen.
