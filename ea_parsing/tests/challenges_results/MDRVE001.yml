  items:
  - The VRC confronted the need to complete new assessments some months after the
    onset of the emergency to guarantee that the information available on the current
    needs within collective centres and other shelter solutions was still valid, in
    order to decide and act appropriately considering the high mobility of people
    entering and leaving collective centres.
  - As it was mentioned in previous updates, it is been some time since the National
    Society carried an operation of this size in coordination with the IFRC. One of
    the main challenges that resulted because of this was a common difficulty on some
    branches with the distribution tracking reports. However the RIT member deployed
    to Venezuela supported the National Society in this regard.
  - Transportation was an issue in some cases, as the distance between affected communities
    was lengthy and the road access was not ideal. However, the appeal covered vehicle
    maintenance, repairs and spare parts, as well as car rental when the need arose.
  - Geographic location was a factor that affected the initial plan for emergency
    relief, the VRC had to adapt to the fact that the needs of those who lost their
    homes but lived in the Capital District were quite different than those from people
    who lived in the countryside. In this regard the distribution cleaning kits that
    had items related to control and prevent mosquito-related diseases were mostly
    relocated to the regional branches, as people living in collective centres and
    emergency shelters built with zinc, plastic and cardboard in those areas were
    much more exposed to the risk of this kind of diseases.
  - High rotation of volunteers and staff to cover the needs caused issues in warehouse
    management; the use of proper tools such as warehouse management software and
    logistics training could improve the situation and ensure better control.

  items:
  - As previously seen on the challenges that arose during the relief distribution,
    access to remote communities and transportation between communities is an issue
    due to the length and conditions of the roads. This was again an issue when reaching
    communities for health-related interventions.
  - A delay in the transfer of funds for operational use caused further inconveniences
    when procuring key items for field visits.
  - The fact that the rains continued affecting roads that had already suffered considerable
    damage and recurrent flooding of some areas also slowed down the pace of the operation.
