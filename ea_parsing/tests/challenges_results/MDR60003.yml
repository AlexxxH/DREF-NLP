  items:
  - "\uF076  There was delay in the start of the operations hence it led to hurried\
    \ implementation and failure of the Federation to undertake National Society Development\
    \ (in the implementation period August \u2013 December 2017)"
  - With the donor (ICRC) restriction in geographical coverage and response options,
    communities accused the National Society of bias as well as offering them non-priority
    assistance
  - Low capacity of the National Societies to access hard-to reach areas led to reduction
    in geographical coverage and number of people reached by the interventions. Such
    can be perceived as bias and is damaging the National Society credibility as responder
    of first choice in disaster
  - The long targeting tools prolonged periods of beneficiary selection
  - Serious security problems at the border between Oromia and Somali regions of Babile
    woreda jeopardize the operation for 2 months
  - Frequent turnover of government higher officials, especially of conflict induced
    areas of Somali & Oromia region created a communication gap
  - Revision of the operational plan of conducting water tracking created dissatisfaction
    among the community (e.g. Afar, Kuri district)
  - Delay in budget transfer and budget settlement from the concerned bodies affected
    the performance of the implementation
  - The changeover in Government administration in Somaliland has impacted on the
    speed at which SRCS is able to obtain customs clearance and tax exemption for
    cargo clearing and transport of relief items into Puntland. As noted previously,
    the change-over in administration means the SRCS must develop new relationships
    with the incoming Government. IFRC Hargeisa is currently in negotiation with WFP
    regarding the re-shipment of cargo in Berbera to Bosasso in Puntland
  - A key development in January was the military confrontation between Somaliland
    and Puntland in the disputed territories in Sool and Sanaag which both Governments
    claim. This confrontation was prompted by the stated intention of the President
    of FRG in Mogadishu to visit territory in Sool accompanied by representatives
    of the Puntland administration. Military forces of Somaliland attacked and took
    control of territory previously controlled by Puntland. The Somaliland administration
    immediately began to reinforce its control of the area and at other points along
    the of January the Government of Puntland declared  line of control (Sool and
    Sanaag) On the 13 war on Somaliland. In response the Government of Somaliland
    stated that it has no intention of attacking Puntland but will defend its territory
    which it defines as up the point of the colonially established border. The initial
    military operation has caused displacement of civilians within Sool. To date there
    have been ongoing low-level exchanges of artillery and gun fire between the opposing
    armies. As a result of this, the planned distribution of WASH/NFIs has been put
    on hold pending an assessment of the situation.
  - "Logistics \u2013 rain from July to November made overland transportation routes\
    \ impossible to bypass. Flying supplies to hard-to-reach areas was the only possibility."
  - For the second year in a row in 2017, South Sudan was ranked as the most dangerous
    context for humanitarian workers in the world, having reported the highest frequency
    of attacks on aid staffers. The operations had to be adaptable to the changing
    security environment in the areas of implementation. This posed challenges to
    planning.
  - The SSRC is a young national society that is still working on enhancing its capacity,
    systems and infrastructure.
