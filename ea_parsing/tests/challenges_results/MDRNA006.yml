  - Having responded to several emergencies related to floods, there is a need to
    support communities to construct houses that are more resistant to floods as a
    lasting solution.  This will ensure appropriate living conditions as a way to
    minimize vulnerability among those already vulnerable, and aiming to reduce risks
    for severe damage by simple yet innovative infrastructural techniques of raising
    foundations while using traditional construction material and architecture. The
    National Society is looking into supporting these populations whose homesteads
    have been damaged and do not have the resources to rebuild them. In total about
    350 households were identified in collaboration with the regional councils in
    the seven flood affected regions and only 70 households could be supported in
    this programme. The aim is to reduce the number of people relocating every year
    due to poor housing. Similarly, some of these identified needs for shelter and
    initiatives related to living with floods will be addressed through the Zambezi
    River Basin Initiative (ZRBI) programme in the Caprivi region.

  - Although the communities have returned back to their respective homesteads, there
    is a need to continue with hygiene promotion due to poor sanitation in many villages.  This
    will reduce the risk to water borne diseases in these villages. The other situation
    is that, there have been a lot of contaminations of water sources this year therefore
    the communities have to be supplied with sufficient water markers to reduce the
    risks towards water born disease.
  - Due to the outbreak of cholera  that was in Angola, the Society continues to conduct
    hygiene promotion and also conducting disease surveillance through the volunteers
    in an attempt to contain the diseases in case of any outbreak.
