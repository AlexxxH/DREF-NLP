  - Difficult road access to accommodation centres
  - Lack of trucks

  - Shifting numbers of potential beneficiaries at the camps.
  - "Some accommodation centres remained inaccessible until early April and goods had to be transported via air \u2013 thereby increasing the frequency and affecting the low daily volume of distributions. In total, close to 220 distributions were made - half of which were by helicopter."
  - The total number of families in accommodation centres increased over time, presumably as some families were drawn to the centres by on-going food and non-food relief distributions, regardless of whether they were affected by the floods or not. The Red Cross decided to stick to its original targets with regard to beneficiary numbers as per its initial assessments; as a result, beneficiary 9 numbers were at times lower than figures provided by INGC or actual numbers of beneficiaries in the camps. In some cases, the Red Cross divided rations so that every camp resident received support; in others, distributions were only made to families directly affected by the floods and already on Red Cross beneficiary lists.
