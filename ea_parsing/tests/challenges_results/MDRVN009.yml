  items:
  - Due to increased cases of HFMD and dengue and the potential disease outbreaks
    after the flood, VNRC was able to incorporate HFMD and dengue prevention messages
    in this Mekong flood operation. VNRC was able to deploy active trainers to train
    volunteers and roll out behaviour change activities in communes with high number
    of HFMD cases. However, due to time limitations, activities such as monitoring
    behaviour change needs improvement. In addition, behaviour change requires follow-up
    and repeated key messages for households in high risk areas, VNRC will need to
    continue integrating health education, particularly hand-washing into its long-
    term program such as risk reduction and community-based health. Another area that
    remains a challenge for VNRC is better coordination and integration of emergency
    health and disaster response in term of approach, and operational mechanism. During
    the operation, it is observed that systems for disease/epidemic and disaster tracking
    needs to be better coordinated for more effective response. Similarly, continuing
    having disaster management and emergency health unit working together in planning
    and execution of responses will help the operation more effective and timely to
    the end-user beneficiaries. The shortcomings around coordination has been taken
    into consideration, to be addressed in the longer-term programme, through further
    improvement of inter-department collaboration in VNRC before and during disasters.

  - "During the operation, it shows that VNRC\u201Fs capacity in water and sanitation\
    \ response in emergency has been improved through deployment of equipment and\
    \ team to the affected area shortly after the disaster. The shortcoming in the\
    \ deployment is the need to carry out a thorough needs assessment before the deployment.\
    \ Although a general assessment was included in all training for trainers over\
    \ the years, however, it was more focused on assessment of water source. Thus,\
    \ in the long-term water and sanitation and disaster management programme, it\
    \ is needed to bring in identified lesson-learned from previous operation and\
    \ more practical sessions on need assessment covering needs and conditions for\
    \ water treatment unit deployment."
  - At operational level, VNRC used the same trained volunteers for emergency health
    for raising awareness of community in prevention of water-borne diseases. On one
    hand, it is good for efficiency as volunteers were equipped with a wider knowledge
    of disease prevention and health education, thus expanding their education activities
    for affected communes. The volunteers were also able to quickly carry out awareness
    raising activities and campaigns in target communes shortly after the operation
    was started. On the other hand, the workload for volunteers was a lot more, and
    as a result, monitoring of behaviour change among target families was not adequately
    emphasized and implemented. Sanitation and hygiene promotion was also an area
    that interventions were not intensified in the actual execution, limiting the
    impact of the overall responses in water and sanitation in emergency. Again, the
    lessons learned around monitoring and having a disease and disaster tracking system
    for timely and effectively response will need to be considered and addressed through
    the longer-term capacity building and development programme.

  items:
  - 'Design: Allocation of funds and the initial of agreement on the design, size
    and total funding contribution was a challenge faced at the early onset. In spite
    of VNRC, IFRC and PNS agreeing on an improved approach from experience of Ketsana,
    there still remained a challenge around the allocated budget being insufficient
    during the implementation phase. This was very much variation to differences in
    the 3 locations, inflation and cost for suppliers and labor. Adjustments were
    made throughout the implementation phase in order to address these challenges.'
  - 'Supervision: Average construction time per house in the programme was some 45
    days. Construction site was scattered over the three provinces and accessible
    mainly by boats. Given such a workload of the DWF supervisors, it was evident
    that it was not possible to fully meet the requirements of the Instruction of
    Supervision. Weekly visits would not be sufficient to provide adequate control
    of the works: a position borne out by the errors identified. Acknowledging a lack
    of supervision and accountability to beneficiaries, VNRC, with the support from
    IFRC, strengthened its ongoing monitoring to the work to ensure the quality of
    the construction as well as the progress of the programme. It was worth noting
    that each shelter focal person paid his minimum 5 visits per house within the
    programme timeframe.'
  - 'Partnership: Taking the advantage of experience gained in the Ketsana recovery
    programme in 2009, VNRC focused into further investment in building its technical
    capacity in terms of shelter programming locally through partnership with DWF.
    A notable difference to the Ketsana programme was the more involved role of VNRC,
    demonstrating a growing capacity and confidence as the programme progressed. Key
    stakeholders described changes to the roles and responsibilities, but the MOU
    was adopted without significant modification. The complexity in the relationship
    of the primary stakeholders created some gaps in management, responsibility, and
    accountability. This related also to the reporting mechanisms. Efforts were made
    through the implementation phase in order to optimize the gaps.'
  - Finance management support - The capacity of the householders to manage additional
    construction work outside of the agreed design for extensions and alterations
    varied from household to household, and was an area that VNRC recognized additional
    support and close monitoring by project staff.
  - It was also recognized that for future projects there remained an opportunity
    in further expansions of the shelter programme to include a component on project
    and financial management  for beneficiaries, to ensure that they fully understand
    the implications of the owner driven housing project, and any the importance in
    financial management if additional work is to be carried out.

    Taking into consideration, the unpredictability of disasters and the ever growing

    preparedness for all provinces across the country. Enhancing VNRC and community
    capacities to cope and respond to disasters contributes to saving lives, speeds
