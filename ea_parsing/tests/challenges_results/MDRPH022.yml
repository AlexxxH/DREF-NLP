  items:
  - 1. Many of the barangays/municipalities in the scope of the project have limited
    water and sanitation infrastructures. Most of the barangays depend on ponds, tube
    wells and gravity feed systems as their main source of water for drinking, cooking
    and cleaning.
  - 2. Low visibility of or low priority for water and sanitation awareness in the
    barangays or at municipalities means there is a significant need for safe water
    and sanitation infrastructure and promotion. This was particularly the case in
    Barangay San Vicente with the Dupaningan tribe where PRC was able to support with
    water and sanitation infrastructure and the software components.
  - 3. Many of the barangays and municipalities are not connected with the National
    Water Resources Board (NWRB) which prevents a significant amount of water and
    sanitation related awareness programme and infrastructure development. Communities
    in the mountainous areas depend on tube wells and gravity feed systems and most
    of the private companies do not have access to these areas. This is a key area
    where PRC could play a significant role in supporting the municipal governments
    in the realization of water and sanitation hardware and software component.

  - 1 For Household Livelihoods now, there was no significant impact in terms of livelihood
    restoration since most of the beneficiaries are still rearing their livestock
    options.
  - "2 The livelihood intervention was complemented with a technical training on livestock\
    \ management in collaboration with the Department of Agriculture through the Municipal\
    \ Agriculture\u2019s Office. This approach gained appreciation from the beneficiaries\
    \ because they could receive technical inputs related to their livelihood options."
  - 3 One of the key recommendations during KII and FGD was the provision of business
    management training for the beneficiaries. This would help them do financial management
    and better business planning to improve their livelihood options and promote sustainability.
  - "4 For the community-managed project, there was a lack of management capacity.\
    \ Since this was a newly formed association, most of the members didn\u2019t have\
    \ knowledge on how to manage an association. This gap was initially identified\

  items:
  - 1 One of the main challenges for shelter is the huge need versus the financial
    capacity to respond and support the needs of the community. In Cagayan, a total
    of 25,388 houses were destroyed and 110,936 were damaged while a total of 10,264
    houses were destroyed and 52,496 were damaged in Isabela.
  - 2 Due to lack of funding resources the appeal did not support the construction
    of core houses but instead concentrated on repairs. Additionally, the SRA package
    was not always sufficient to fully repair/reconstruct the damaged houses. The
    SRA package was limited in its dual function to repair the house and also ensure
    the build back safer principles were applied.
  - 3 There was scarcity of labour force for construction during the implementation
    of the shelter programme due to the high demand of skilled workers in the area.
    To mitigate this issue, the operational team formed groups of trained carpenters
    and masons. These groups were mobilized to do construction works from one community
    to other.
  - 4 In this operation, skilled workers reported that the wages they received was
    less compared to the labour work they had provided. The rate should be based on
    the daily minimum wage in their respective areas. Days of work and the number
    of carpenters required for a repair should be estimated by a technical person
    (i.e. engineer and architect).
