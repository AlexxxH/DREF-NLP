  - 1. For future interventions, having the option of requesting a DREF with sufficient available funds to develop a more efficient and effective emergency aid stage to prevent a lack of predisposed funds, together with an appeal aimed at resiliency and livelihoods recovery actions. This option allows timely and proper planning and identification efforts under the appeal, which makes the intervention more comprehensive in nature.
  - 2. For future interventions it is necessary to either consider reducing geographical and population coverage, or to conduct actions in a phased manner (based on existing funds) and to later add areas based on funds forecast. While this would promote less coverage, it would enable the planning of actions that have a more holistic approach and focus on resilience and livelihoods (as is warranted in a drought emergency), and not only on assistance.

  items:
  - The purchase and distribution of jerrycans becomes less effective if not accompanied by water distribution, and, likewise, not airing radio spots during the implementation phase reduces the impact thereof.
  - Planning of water distributions needs to be better analyzed in future projects due to the high cost of distribution, the National Society's capacity in terms of tanker trucks, and the limited or non-existent access to communities due to Honduran topography.
  - External coordination established through the Multi-sectorial Drought Committee led by COPECO and integrated by various government and non-governmental organizations contributed to avoiding a duplication of efforts in targeted areas in terms of food delivery; however, given the purely emergency nature of this table, we consider that the coordination of other actions - such as livelihoods and water and sanitation - would have been more pertinent in other spaces with a profile aimed more at recovery and rehabilitation (Government- FAO Table - water and sanitation table - other agents).
