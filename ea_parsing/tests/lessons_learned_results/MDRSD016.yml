  items:
  - 5. Although, SRCS has long years of experience in responding to emergencies, SRCS DM and Operations department needs to be further strengthened to effectively respond to multiple emergencies and to ensure that there is greater participation of all key sectors in the operations.
  - 6. Future operations should also strengthen mechanisms for Monitoring, Reporting and Accountability, since securing travel permits is sometimes lengthy and challenging. During the time of this operation, IFRC had supported initiatives for strengthening Beneficiary Communication and Accountability to beneficiaries. Although it was too early for these initiatives to have an impact on the operations, the support has been well received by the national society to be included in all its plans. HQ linkages with branches in PMER needs to further strengthened to ensure timely support from partners. Branches in general were seen to be in need of better guidance and support from higher levels. This was also evident from the partnership between White Nile branch had with UNHCR through which, field based presence and support of UNHCR contributed to regular and improved quality of reports from the branch.
  - 7. There is also need to provide greater support for financial management at all levels within the national society. Delayed financial reporting from branches and from headquarters to IFRC has been a problem and which affected activity planning and implementation. Improvement of financial management procedures and systems can contribute to more effective response.

  - SRCS interventions in WASH has had very positive impact on the targeted population and acknowledged by the state Ministry of Health. However, expectations by other humanitarian actors from SRCS have been greater than existing NS capacities. A comprehensive strategy for WASH in emergencies and prioritizing interventions based on SRCS strengths and capacities will assist SRCS to be more effective and have better visibility.
  - Although water production did not meet sphere standards, WASH assistance under the Complex Emergency was acknowledged by WES programme as providing good quality safe drinking water that contributed to reducing incidence of diarrheal and other waterborne diseases among the affected population. By working in close collaboration with WES and SMoH, SRCS interventions have contributed to sustainability in provision of services for affected communities.
