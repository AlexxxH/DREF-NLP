  items:
  - The response to the 2008 hurricane season was the largest emergency response operation
    conducted by the National Society in the last 15 years, and as such has had a
    notable impact on the institution, strengthening existing processes and highlighting
    capacity-building areas for future emergency response operations.
  - 'Emergency relief: The quick response of and close coordination between the National
    Society and the Pan American Disaster Response Unit (PADRU) following the impact
    of the hurricane ensured that a coherent Plan of Action was drawn up that responded
    to the immediate needs of the affected population.  In particular, the use of
    prepositioned relief items in warehouses in the region and their quick deployment
    to the country made it possible for the Red Cross to provide immediate relief
    to beneficiaries. However, the fluctuation of the prices of some relief items
    indicates that it may be necessary to conduct a study of the market and existing
    agreements with suppliers in the region, in particular for those products for
    which there is the greatest demand.'
  - "Institutional strengthening: The operation has served to strengthen links between\
    \ the Cuban Red Cross\u2019 national headquarters and the provincial and municipal\
    \ branches, not only improving internal relations but also transferring capacity\
    \ in the technical and operational roles of emergency management."
  - 'Development and integration of broader, longer-term recovery strategies: The
    inclusion of an early recovery component in the CRC plan of action has provided
    much needed, valuable longer- term support to the affected communities in their
    recovery from the aftermath of the hurricanes. At the same time it is promoting
    and developing new skill sets within the Cuban Red Cross regional branches which
    will be key in providing integral response.'
  - 'Recruitment, training and promotion of volunteers: In total, 139 new volunteers
    were recruited from the affected communities, with local populations keen to support
    the work of the Red Cross in the development of the operation. The response also
    afforded the opportunity to provide training to volunteers at the local level,
    including specialized training in disaster response and preparedness.'
  - 'Strengthening of inter-institutional links: Close coordination with all actors
    involved in the response was required, improving relations with national and local
    authorities and non- governmental organizations, as well as with members of the
    Red Cross Red Crescent Movement. This served to consolidate existing and new partnerships
    vital to respond not only to this but to future emergencies.'
  - 'Strengthening of community links: By its very nature, an operation such as this
    serves to strengthen links with affected communities, not only in the immediate
    response but in the early recovery and recovery phases, enhancing a greater understanding
    of community needs and establishing priorities for continued action in these areas.
    Actions developed under the operation have served to strengthen links with formal
    and informal community leaders, as well as in the recruitment of community volunteers.'
  - Although the operation has officially ended, the CRC continues its work in responding
    to community needs and in addressing broader disaster risk reduction issues.
  - "On behalf of Cuban Red Cross, the International Federation would like to thank\
    \ all partners and donors for their generous response to this appeal. The operation\
