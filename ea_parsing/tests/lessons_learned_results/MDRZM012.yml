  items:
  - Protection, gender, and inclusion issues are important aspects to consider in
    selecting beneficiaries and volunteers signing of code of conduct at the beginning
    of the operation. In addition, this operation brought forth a lesson that public
    selection and validation of beneficiaries minimizes bias and increases chances
    that the marginalised populations in communities will be identified and selected
    to benefit from humanitarian assistance.
  - Feedback collection mechanisms and ensuring a process of listening to and incorporating
    insights from all types, of feedback, including complaints and compliment, are
    important tools in cash transfer projects.
  - Multiple modes of feedback are important as they provide opportunities to beneficiaries
    and non-beneficiaries to take part in improving the project strategies for improved
    implementation. Red Cross actors can also use these different streams of information
    to triangulate feedback and identify the most critical to apply to improving the
    response.
