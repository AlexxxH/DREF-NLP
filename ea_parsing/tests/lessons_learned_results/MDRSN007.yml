  items:
  - This food insecurity operation was the first of its kind in which the Senegalese Red Cross was involved and operational right from the onset, when the crisis was identified late 2011 in certain regions of Senegal.
  - In its role as an auxiliary of the authorities, SRCS was selected as one of the main partners of WFP for the delivery of emergency food, financial and humanitarian assistance in seven regions. With a contribution of some CHF 3.4 million given by the authorities to WFP to assure food distribution to over 500,000 beneficiaries living in the vulnerable targeted regions.
  - The National Society headquarters has worked very effectively with its Red Cross branches and with the local authorities and the beneficiaries; through its humanitarian service delivery SRCS has been very well perceived by the population and has been praised on the national media.
  - SRCS Beneficiary selection procedures were improved providing a more community based and inclusive approach.
  - The operations in Senegal focused more on emergency assistance than on longer term livelihood projects, contributing to building the resilience of the targeted beneficiaries. During an exit meeting, future plans were discussed and the National Society leadership and management agreed this was an objective they would consider engaging in more in depth any future food security programming.
  - As resilience building requires longer-term follow-up, the SRCS will in the future consider planning resilience building initiatives earlier in the appeal process.
  - The beneficiary to household count in the Emergency Appeal for Senegal was based on a seven persons per family. Into the operations, however, it was revealed that the reality particularly in rural areas where a family size can reach up to 30 people. In those cases a double ration was delivered to these big households.
  - The experience of the cash transfer or direct cash assistance has proved to be a valuable support process for many communities in need. SRCs taking on increased measures to build its capacity in this activity, and has been chosen as one of the leading National Societies that will carry forward the process after all the necessary training. The International Federation selected four pilot countries (Viet Nam, Philippines, Chile and Senegal) to support their National Societies with training and coaching, ensuring cash transfers and market assessment are embedded into their existing preparedness measures and Contingency Planning (CP) so that when a disaster occurs, an operation with a scalable cash transfer components will come rapidly into being. On 14 February 2013, with the financial support of ECHO and British Red Cross, the pilot project with the Senegalese Red Cross Society (SRCS) was launched. It is expected that the case studies and lessons learned from this pilot project will allow reaching other countries in the future.
  - The appeal was 75 percent funded with the main donors being the Finnish, Canadian, Danish, British, Monaco and Japanese Red Cross Societies with the Canadian Red Cross also supporting the operations manager. The IFRC on behalf of the the Senegalese Red Cross Society would like to extend thanks to all these partners for their generous contributions to this appeal.
