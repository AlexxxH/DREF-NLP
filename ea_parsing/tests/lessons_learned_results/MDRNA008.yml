  - 'In July 2014, a Food Security Assessment was done in Kunene by an external consultant
    with the following objectives:'
  - To assess the food and nutrition security, livelihoods, coping mechanisms and
    underlying vulnerabilities of different population groups in Kunene and identify
    potential risks associated with the failure of the rains;
  - To support development of a contingency plan and long-term food and nutrition
    security strategic plan;
  - To assess the capacity of Namibia Red Cross Society in implementation of the proposed
    food and nutrition security;
  - To evaluate previous interventions impact.
  - The conclusions of the study on the impact of the drought operation implemented
    by Namibia Red Cross Society (NRCS) was that while all households in the affected
    areas received government led food assistance, a comparison of NRCS beneficiaries
    and non-beneficiaries indicated total incomes, dietary diversity and Coping Strategy
    Index indicators were relatively better for Namibia Red Cross Society beneficiaries.
    This is an indication of a positive project outcome by the NRCS intervention.
    Recommendations formulated by the external assessment team included the need for
    a continuation of interventions as they were still relevant and appropriate given
    the food deficits faced by households. However, they found that Namibia Red Cross
    Society needs to develop a clear strategy on graduation from emergency phase to
    recovery and development with the overall aim of ensuring resilience among households
    to the recurring hazard of drought and other common shocks. The national society
    itself concluded at the end of the operation that there is need to invest in building
    local staff capacity in disaster response so that they will be able to provide
    rapid, timely response to emergencies leading to reduced delays associated with
    recruitment of international staff/delegates.
  - "The national society appreciates the support of both local and international\
    \ partners and the contributions made to the Emergency Appeal. Contributions were\
    \ received from the American Red Cross, British Red Cross, Canadian Red Cross\
    \ (from Canadian Government), Japanese Red Cross, Netherlands Red Cross (from\
    \ Netherlands Red Cross Silent Emergency Fund), Swedish Red Cross, (from Swedish\
    \ Government), Luxembourg Government, European Commission \u2013 DG ECHO, Red\
    \ Cross of Monaco, USAID, UNICEF and local businesses."
