DREF Operational Learning initiative 
Categorisation of Operational Learning Guide
Introduction
As a flagship tool of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) has, for decades, supported National Societies to have access to the necessary resources to carry out emergency response interventions and provide lifesaving services to the affected population after a small or medium scale disaster. To ensure that funds are allocated in an adequate manner the DREF Guidelines are there to help the National Society and the Regional Office to asses if what is proposed meets the eligibility criteria and provide guidance on what can and cannot be done, and how. 
The DREF is a flexible funding source for emergency, which can provide financial support rapidly when a disaster exceeds the National Societies´ response capacities. The DREF provides funding to National Societies in the following situations:
i. start-up funding loans to allow immediate response to major disasters;
ii. grants to cover the costs of mobilisation of resources and preparation for emergency response in the case of imminent crisis and to cover the costs of smaller-scale relief operations. 
The DREF finances the provision of short-term relief which aims to preserve life and to substitute for the loss of means of basic subsistence of people affected.
From 2011 to 2018, the DREF have supported with grants an average of 88 annually operations worldwide, providing National Societies with the opportunity to support those affected by small disasters and crises. When provided with a grant, National Societies are required to provide with a narrative and financial report of the operation, highlighting the achievements in implementing the response.
Since 2013 in order to foster learnings from not only big scale emergencies but also small and medium scale emergencies, DREF funded operations started institutionalising the DREF Lessons Learnt workshop to discuss with the NSs what has worked well, what were the challenges and what are the recommendations for the next operations. Typically, after this workshop a NS publishes the DREF final report for the DREF operation. As of now these reports are stored on the ifrc.org and not being utilised systematically by NSs nor IFRC offices. 
Purpose of this guide
The main purpose of this initiative is to systematise the collection and use of the valuable lessons learnt, and challenges faced by the NSs during DREF operations. It hopes to contribute to institutionalisation of a learning culture within emergency operations to better respond to disaster and crisis. The initiative will do this by using the Preparedness for Effective Response mechanism (i.e. 37 components) to accomplish additional objectives of:
• NSs can have systematised and consolidated data on DREF operations over time
• Support planning of new operations by NSs based upon previous experiences on emergency responses
• Increasing technical staff and functional departments access and use of the findings from the final DREF reports. This will allow them to better understand the NS to cater technical support based on evidence to strengthen the overall operations
• Evidence-based systematised learning from DREF funded emergency operations can encourage NSs on peer to peer learning
• Aligning the DREF operations learnings with the PER mechanism will ensure the continuum of investing into NS preparedness, as the recommendations and learnings from the operations are closely related to improving NS response preparedness elements, and can be incorporated into future operational planning
About PER/NDPRM
For most NS, responding to emergencies is a key service that they provide in-country, and in line with their auxiliary role and mandate. As such preparedness activities for NSs are routine. To strengthen these preparedness actions, the IFRC has continuously prioritised NS preparedness1 and developed guidelines and tools to systematise and consolidate preparedness actions, more recently mainstreaming a common NS Preparedness approach. At the core of these preparedness initiatives is the NS preparedness and response mechanism, which has been evolving over time, a diagram below demonstrates the evolution of this mechanism. 

The Preparedness for Effective Response (PER) is a harmonised and revised IFRC NS Preparedness approach that is being utilised among the Partners, NSs and IFRC Secretariat for NSs to be better prepared and provide effective emergency services in times of disaster and crisis. It attempts to ensure that Movement stakeholders have a common understanding and coordinated approach when they invest on NS response capacity. The PER brings together existing institutional disaster preparedness tools and is well-aligned with other Movement initiatives. The PER is not new, in fact, it is built on two decades of learnings from Well-Prepared National Societies (WPNS) and Disaster Response Capacity Enhancement (DRCE) tools. The foundation of the PER is National Disaster Preparedness and Response Mechanism’s (NDPRM) components.
The NDPRM (2010) guideline presents a set of practical guidelines that are designed to support NSs in developing the preparedness for response processes, systems and teams. By following the guideline NSs will be able to improve their capacity in disaster preparedness and response; to ensure that their work meet global standards on disaster preparedness and response; and to coordinate their approaches with other NSs and organisations. The key considerations in the guideline are that it:
• explains how to develop the political will within National Society to set up the mechanism. 
• sets out the tasks involved in ensuring that conditions are ready to establish the mechanism. 
• outlines the key steps in implementing the mechanism.

The National Disaster Preparedness and Response mechanism currently encompasses thirty-seven components organised across five interrelated areas of (1) Policy, Strategy and Standards, (2) Analysis and Planning, (3) Operational Capacity, (4) Coordination and (5) Operations Support.


Use of this guide
This guide helps to categorise learnings captured in the DREF operations final report within the PER mechanism as a frame. Progress of response operations funded by DREF are usually captured by “output” within Area of Focus (AoF) which includes the activities, or within Strategies for Implementation (SFI) which includes general activities not directly related to a specific area. During the development of the report, for every output, National Societies are expected to write about:
• Achievements related to the implementation of the planned activities.
• Challenges and gaps with the implementation of the response
• Lesson learned coming from implementing the response
• Develop capacities based on gap analysis 
Every challenge and lesson will be categorised according to the its AoF or SFI provided by the report and based according to the NDPRM/PER Mechanism component, to ensure a more detailed analysis of the learning coming from the operation. 
This document provides the necessary guidance to be able to categorise challenges and learnings using the components of the NDPRM. The guide highlights the 5 areas of the mechanism, and their respective components. For each component, the following information is provided to help with categorization of findings:
• Definition: a short explanation of the component and its relationship with the response operation.
• Examples: examples of tagging of real challenges and learnings that fall under that component.
• Considerations: key points to guide the identification of challenges and learnings falling under the component.
For those involved in categorising operational learning, it is recommended to read this guide first to familiarise with the NDPRM/PER mechanism and the relationship of the components to the response. It is also recommended to use the 1 pager of NDPRM components as a reference to keep in mind of the possible components when tagging a final report. This guide can then be used as a reference to verify during the categorisation. 


Guidance for the categorisation of operational learning
Policy, Strategy and Standards
Component 1: RCRC Auxiliary role, mandate and lawDefinition: A constitutional reference to the role of the NS in responding to disasters and crises, which may be legislated or included/recognised in the National Response System.Some examples of tagging
- Challenge: The NS requested this DREF to respond to epidemics, which is not established as part of our mandate and therefore, little capacity had been developed among ours staff and volunteers to deal with this type of emergency.
- Lesson:  It is clear that there is a need for more awareness to the X Government to clarify the X NS Role as an Auxiliary to the Government.Considerations:
- Lessons learnt and challenges for the operations related to NS mandate, its role within national response and unclear role of staff and volunteers to provide services in this area/context
- NS facing challenges during operations due to ambiguity or non-existing legal act establishing NS as auxiliaries to the government, different to other NGOs
Component 2: Disaster Risk Management (DRM) StrategyDefinition: An outline of the overall goal in disaster risk management that the NS seeks to achieve within a certain timeframe, which may define the target proportion of affected populations that will be reached and define areas/sectors where a NS responds.Some examples of tagging
- Challenge: There was not enough clarity on the roles of the different departments during the response, the NS needs to develop a strategy with clear roles to ensure a more effective response.
- Lesson: There is need for DRM activities to focus on strengthening existing shelters to be resilient for future similar disastersConsiderations:
- Potential operational learnings that highlight the need for a clear DRM strategy to guide a NS on disasters and crises
- NSs that are responding often to certain disaster types, would mean there is a recommendation of a NS to improve and solidify their intention in this area of work, and have a long-term strategy for such disaster/crisis 
Component 3: Disaster Risk Management (DRM) PolicyDefinition: Reflects the NS disaster risk management mission in line with RCRC principles and mandate. The NS DRM policy acknowledges other relevant NS policies and aligns with the government policies on disaster management.Some examples of tagging
- Challenge: NS had difficulties in coordinating with other actors on the ground when responding to epidemics as the national DM policy does not mandate the RC to respond to human epidemics, NSs in the past years have been investing a lot within epidemics preparedness
- Lesson: NS need to revisit the NS DM policy as cash was not reflected in the wider DM policy and NS in the future operations will be doing Cash Transfer Programming.   Considerations:
- Challenges and lessons learnt referring to the NS disaster management policy which impacts on the emergency services that NS is providing
- Challenges that NS may encounter with the conflicting NS DM policies and national DM policies
- DM policies may impact on the decision-making of NSs in times of disasters and crises as to what to respond, what to prioritise and how to work with other stakeholders

Component 4: Disaster Risk Management Laws, Advocacy and DisseminationDefinition: Supports NSs operations in terms of legal facilities (i.e. special entitlements and exemptions including customs clearance and duties, transport permission, visas and others)Some examples of tagging
- Challenge: NS did not have an expedited visa for RCRC personnel, therefore, the deployment of the RDRT was delayed by a month 
- Lesson: After the issues with the visa, as well as lack of agreements for expedited customs clearance the NS will be developing IDRL training and awareness to address these issues.Considerations:
- Restrictions and delays in customs clearance for relief goods and equipment
- Imposition of duties, tolls and other taxes on relief items and activities
- Difficulties and delays in obtaining and renewing necessary visas and permits for humanitarian personnel
- Problems obtaining legal recognition of foreign professional qualifications for specialised personnel (particularly medical staff)
- Difficulties in legal registration for foreign humanitarian organisations, leading to restrictions in opening bank accounts and hiring local staff
- Importation of unnecessary or inappropriate relief items
Component 5: Quality and AccountabilityDefinition: This component describes essential elements of principled, accountable and high-quality humanitarian operation. Some examples of tagging
- Challenge: Post-distribution survey stated that NFIs distributed was no longer needed, at the time school materials were more necessary than blankets.
- Lesson: NS needs to strengthen its community engagement and accountability to ensure that the beneficiaries are involved at every stage of the operation, from planning to implementation and reporting
- Lesson: There is a need to develop better feedback and accountability systems hence, it is recommended that NS would need to get training to improve on Community engagement and accountability.Considerations:
- Community engagement and accountability
- Do no harm
- Code of Conduct for the RCRC Movement
- Accountability to affected populations and disability considerations
Analysis and Planning
Component 6: Hazard, Context and Risk Analysis, Monitoring and Early WarningDefinition: Describes how the NS monitors and maps past, present and potential hazards, disasters and crises and systematically evaluates the damage that could be caused by a potential disaster/crisis and possible challenges during a response operation that is related to hazard, context and risk analysis.Some examples of tagging
- Challenge: Lack of access due to severely damaged roads delayed the assessment as the branches did not have the necessary equipment and transport to reach the affected population
- Lesson: For future operations the NS needs to consider setting the Early Warning Systems in place to ensure timely evacuationConsiderations:
- The impact of gaps, barriers, risks and challenges identified to NS acceptance, security and access during response operations
- Challenges and lessons learned related to the establishment, management or lack of early warning systems
Component 7: Scenario planning Definition: A set of practical operation plans that closely mirror the generic disaster or crisis response plan but are tailored to a specific hazard type and a specific scenario.Some examples of tagging
- Challenge: Initially the harsh weather conditions (temperatures ranged from -20 to -30°C) meant that it was challenging for volunteers to reach some communities 
- Lesson: It is apparent that colder winters and the spread of season influenza is likely to remain a threat, so the NS will be increasingly aware of making contingency plans for future outbreaks prior to the winter seasonConsiderations:
- NSs using/not using analysis of humanitarian scenarios for high-risk areas in the country
- Usage or lessons learnt related to contingency plans
- Appropriate trigger mechanisms of contingency plans that may impact on the emergency operation

- Challenges with the quality of procured items.
- Best practices in the mapping of suppliers and expedite procurement procedures.
Component 34d: Fleet and Transportation ManagementDefinition: Refers to the internal system and procedures to ensure the NS transportation assets (vehicles, boats, etc.) are managed appropriately.Some examples of tagging
Challenge: Due to two vehicles from the HQ being damaged, the NS had to hire transportation services for the distribution of items from the central warehouse, which delayed the distribution
 Lesson: Branches would need their own vehicles to transport relief items from their stocks to the distribution points in shorter time particularly to the remote areas, while this was done in collaboration with authoritiesConsiderations:
- Challenges with the use and management of the NS fleet
- Challenges and best practices in the procurement of transportation services
- Lessons about the transportation needs for emergency response
Component 34e: Warehouse and Stock ManagementDefinition: Prepositioned stock should meet Sphere standards. Some examples of tagging
Challenge: The available hygiene items at the warehouse did not comply with sphere standards, they were distributed and through the DREF the NS will ensure that newly procured items meet the standards.
Lesson: After the challenges to identify space for items at the affected areas, all branches with no warehouse will be asked to map the storage spaces available for renting.Considerations:
- Challenges or best practices related to the quality of prepositioned stocks.
- Challenges related to the available space for warehousing.
- Learnings on warehouse management functioning.
Component 35: Staff and Volunteer ManagementDefinition: Well-functioning staff and volunteer management systems and practices allow for effective recruitment, supervision, support and encouragement of staff and volunteers. Some examples of tagging
Challenges: Sanitary napkins were distributed to the target population. However, there was a need for capacity building of the branch staff and volunteers on targeting, identification of beneficiaries and inclusive issues.
Lesson learned: The NS needs to have at least a minimum trained intervention team in each local branch that can be operational with very little briefing.Considerations:
- Needs identified to strengthen the NS volunteers’ and staff’s technical competencies.
- NS HQ and branch HR related challenges during the response (Nation Disaster Response Teams)
- Challenges in the recruitment of new volunteers or staff for the response operation
- Issues and learnings with visibility items of staff and volunteers during emergency operations
- Learnings and recommendations related to personnel rotation and retention strategy for response 
Component 36: Communication in emergenciesDefinition: Incorporates a system of public messaging to enable the NS to share timely, accurate information before, during, and after a disaster or crisis. Some examples of tagging
Challenge: Volunteers provided wrong information about the distribution of household items to community members.
Lesson: Having a good communication system enabled early warning & early action between the branch and HQ during the initial stages of the situation and disaster response.Considerations:
- Challenges with key messages, or lack of, for the emergency response
- Challenges or best practices in the identification of communications focal points.
- Best practices in the communication with affected population and general public about the emergency response
Component 37: Resource MobilisationDefinition: A documented strategy for raising domestic funds from the government, private sector, general public and other in-country actors to support the national society’s response.Some examples of tagging
Challenge: The NS received donations of funds through a bank account, but it was difficult to track the donations as the back account is used for other projects.
Lesson: There is also a need to improve local resource mobilisation strategies so that the NS is also able to raise funds to enable timely response and to be first-responders in-country.Considerations:
- Challenges or best practices for receiving and managing donation of funds.
- Challenges with accountability for donations received.
- Identified needs to improve emergency fund raising systems.
- Identified potential partners/stakeholders during the operation.
